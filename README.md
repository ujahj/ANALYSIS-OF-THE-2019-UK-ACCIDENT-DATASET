# ANALYSIS-OF-THE-2019-UK-ACCIDENT-DATASET
2019 road accident analysis of when, where, and under what conditions accidents happened, and a ML prediction of the conditions under which accidents are most likely to occur in, and the severity of injuries sustained given the conditions they happen under with recommendations based on analysis to improve safety

## Content
Road traffic accident is an event having lead to personal injury or damage to property that has taken place in an area intended for public transport or generally used for transport and in which at least one of the involved parties has been a moving vehicle.
According to figures released by the Department for Transport in the year ending March 2016, over 24,000 people were seriously injured or killed in collisions on the roads in the UK.
All road traffic accidents involving casualties are logged and reported in the United Kingdom, along with (probably) a majority of other non-fatal road traffic accidents. Every year, the government releases a large batch of data associated with these reports and there is a need to analyse these data to gain insights.

## Problem Statement
Government agencies are worried about the alarming rate of road accidents and wish to put in place measures to improve road safety and create a model that would predict such accidents and the injuries that they incur. As a data scientist confronted with the road traffic accident data, Will you help to analyze and advise the Government?
## Objective
The idea behind this Data Science project is to create a thorough analysis of the data by addressing the questions below:

(a)	Are there significant hours of the day, and days of the week, on which accidents occur?

(b)	For motorbikes, are there significant hours of the day, and days of the week, on which accidents occur?

(c)	For pedestrians involved in accidents, are there significant hours of the day, and days of the week, on which they are more likely to be involved?

(d)	What impact, if any, does daylight savings have on road traffic accidents in the week after it starts and stops?

(e)	What impact, if any, does sunrise and sunset times have on road traffic accidents?

(f)	Are there particular types of vehicles (engine capacity, age of vehicle, etc.) that are more frequently involved in road traffic accidents?

(g)	Are there particular conditions (weather, geographic location, situations) that generate more road traffic accidents?

(h)	How does driver related variables affect the outcome (e.g., age of the driver, and the purpose of the journey)?

(i)	Can we make predictions about when and where accidents will occur, and the severity of the injuries sustained from the data supplied to improve road safety? How well do our models compare to government models? 

## Data
Data is the 2019 road traffic data obtained from the ONS site. It is a complete sample with a lot of ancillary data. I have uploaded the relevant data above and it contains the following files:

(1)	Brief-guide-to road-accidents-and-safety-data. This file contains a very short introduction to the data set produced by the government.

(2)	variable lookup. This spreadsheet details the large amount of variables present in each of the datasets. 

(3)	Road Safety Data - Accidents 2019. This spreadsheet contains the details of the accidents logged in 2019.

(4)	Road Safety Data - Casualties 2019. This spreadsheet details the casualties contained in the logged accidents.

(5)	Road Safety Data- Vehicles 2019. This spreadsheet contains the details of the vehicles involved in the accidents. 

(6)	Adjustment Files. These files contain government modelling for the probabilities of different injuries occurring for each accident.

(i)	adjustment figure guidance. This provides a short amount of government guidance on the figures included. 

(ii)	cas_adjustment_lookup_2019. This spreadsheet contains the tabulated adjusted probabilities of injuries.
